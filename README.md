- Cdecl is a program which will turn English-like phrases such as "declare
  foo as array 5 of pointer to function returning int" into C declarations
  such as `int (*foo[5])()` https://cdecl.org/ [[source](https://github.com/ridiculousfish/cdecl-blocks)]

Best aspects of C language
- Low-level languages are harder to program in. Not because they are more complicated, but because they are more error prone and thus require way more commitment, memorizing and fiddling. https://blog.joren.ga/programming/best-of-c

C++: The Good Parts

consteval in C++17
- A common misconception is that constexpr functions are evaluated during compilation and not during runtime. In reality, a constexpr function makes it possible to be evaluated at compile time without guaranteeing it. https://artificial-mind.net/blog/2020/11/14/cpp17-consteval

How expensive is integer-overflow trapping in C++?
- Integers in programming languages have a valid range but arithmetic operations can result in values that exceed such ranges. For example, adding two large integers can result in an integer that cannot be represented in the integer type. We often refer to such error conditions as overflows. https://lemire.me/blog/2020/09/23/how-expensive-is-integer-overflow-trapping-in-c/
