How expensive is integer-overflow trapping in C++?
- Integers in programming languages have a valid range but arithmetic operations can result in values that exceed such ranges. For example, adding two large integers can result in an integer that cannot be represented in the integer type. We often refer to such error conditions as overflows. https://lemire.me/blog/2020/09/23/how-expensive-is-integer-overflow-trapping-in-c/
